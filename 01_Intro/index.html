                <h1 class="page-header">What To Do: </h1>

                    <p class="gray-text">    1. Create a website and make a page with a proposal for a possible final project. <br>
                                                 2. Read Chapters 1-3 of Making Things Move and note down interesting facts. <br>
                                                 3. Research local fab labs and makerspaces. </p>

                 <h1 class="page-header">What I Did: </h1>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> To begin with, I was a little overwhelmed that we had to create a basic website using html and css, as I have no prior experience with either of the two. However, I found a realitvely easy to use template from <a href="https://www.quackit.com/html/templates/simple_website_templates.cfm">here</a>, and I imported and personalized it. The best part is that it's completely free (this isn't sponsored). With a lot of help from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools</a>, I was able to create the bare-bones of a somewhat-working, basic website. My website has key features like images, a working navbar, hyperlinks, etc. There are still many things I don't know to do, like what most of the stuff in the css folder means, but I'm sure with a lot of time and patience, I can learn the basics of css too. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Also, I researched local makerspaces. Although there aren't any that are very close to where I live, there are really good ones closer to Chicago. One of them is <a href="https://fox.build/">Fox.Build: Makerspace, Hackerspace, Coworking</a> located in St. Charles, Illinois, which is about 40 minutes away from my house. Unfortunately, there aren't any day passes, as all of their price listings are for monthly memberships. I'm sure if I reach out to them and ask about day passed, we can work something out. Although, I already have a few power tools and a 3D printer at home, so I can easily make do with what I have. </p><br><br>

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                      <img src="01_Code.JPG" style="width:100%" alt="Webpage Code">
                    </div >

                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                      <p style="text-align: justify"> The code-editing app we are using is Sublime Text. The code in the first image is edited on Sublime Text and is part of my code of this specific webpage. Most of the actual "coding" I am is just changing the template to better suit how I want my website porfolio to look, like changing the header and footer colors using CSS. There's definitely a steep learning curve, but I've been catching on pretty quickly. </p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> With the help of our TA Victoria, I was able to get a few fucnctions working that weren't working before, like the assignment drop-down list, which is at the top of the website. The drop-down list in particular was a headache to figure out, because it just wasn't working properly. The solution was as simple as adding two dots ".." before the JavaScript source. Adding one dot "." means that the source is in the parent folder of the current index. Similarly, adding two dots ".." means that the source is two folders outside of the current index. 

                    <p style="text-align: justify"> I also organized my folders so that in the future, when I want to add something to a certain assignment, it would be simple and easy to understand. The folder list is on the left-hand side of the Sublime Text application. The actual code is on the large section to the right of the folder list. In the image, you can actually see the what these paragraphs I'm writing look like in HTML code. </p> <br> <br> 
                    </div >

                <div class="row">

                  <div class="col-lg-5">
                     <p style="text-align: justify"> The second image is the GitHub Desktop application. Whenever I change my code in Sublime Text, it only changes my website when I locally view it (opened through the index file). So, I use the GitHub Desktop app to push any of my changes that I made in the code to the actual website. In the app, you can see everything that was edited, so you know exactly what you're changing. There is also a way to make a "branch," which is a diversion from the main. So, if I wanted to test a few things but didn't want to edit my main website, I could make a branch and safely test out new code.</p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> The process for uploading on this app is really simple. All I have to do is open the app after I have edited the code, write out a mandatory summary of the changes I made, then click "Commit to main." And just like that, I can easily update my website whenever I want.</p>
