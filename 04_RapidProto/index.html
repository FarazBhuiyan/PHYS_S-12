                    <p style="text-align: justify"> For this assignment, my kinetic sculpture was a foamboard plane with lights that has some degree of roll using cams. I really enjoyed making my kinetic sculpture, even though my first idea of a drawing robot didn't really work out (I talk about why later). In a nutshell, I spent a day on the drawing robot, scrapped the idea, spent a day making the plane sculpture, and then spent the last day making this webpage. I also learned a lot of different things when it comes to using the Metro board, coding on Arduino, troubleshooting Arduino code, etc. This was probably my favorite project out of the 3 we have done so far, as it incorporated many different facets of digital fabrication, like making a physical model, writing up your own code, adding whatever you want to your model, troubleshooting your model, and much more.

            <div class="col-lg-5">
                <p style="text-align: justify"> On the right is a gif of my kinetic sculpture in action. My sculture is simply a model of a plane "flying" with use of some LEDs. The whole thing took about a day to make, including the wiring and coding. There isn't really much to it, as there are 3 only main sections: the plane, the box, and the electronics. </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> This gif is taken in what I call the "main view" perspective. In this main view, the viewer sees the front part of the plane and box. There are minimal wires in the view, although in this gif, you can see a few wires just on the underside of the plane, and of course, the group of wires that hangs off of the back. For that back group of wires, I wanted to hide them as much as possible, but I liked the openness of the whole sculpture, so I didn't make a background. </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> I also wanted to keep the whole sculpture simple. I didn't want to add any pictures or a cover for the Kleenex box. I think the final product turned out really well, especially because of how plain it is. There isn't any fluff in the design either, all of the pieces I incorporated into the sculture is there for a reason. For example, just above the Kleenex box, there is the cam follower guide made out of foamboard. Although I made the component look nice with neat cuts and adhesion, the functionality of the piece is what matters, and it works just as it should.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p style="text-align: justify"> My plane kinetic sculpture idea is actually the second idea for what I wanted to make for this assignment. My first idea was a drawing robot. I really wanted it to work, but it kind of did and kind of didn't. I talk about what happened and its shortcomings below.</p><br>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p style="text-align: justify"> This is my first drawing robot prototype. I say "robot," but it actually requires human control to work. It used two DC motors and two potentiometers to control them. Overall, the code ran fine. I just duplicated and mirrored the code for using the potentiometer to control a motor that we created last week so that it would work with two potentiometers instead of only one.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"> In the image to the right, I used thread instead of blue twine and I designed and 3D-printed a marker holder. Both improved the of the drawing performance a little, but it was still too poor to be considered anything good. </p><br>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
         <p style="text-align: justify"> I think the biggest reason it didn't work out was because it was just a bit too ambitious for my skill level of using new software and hardware that I've never used before. Not to mention I just jumped right into it without really making a small-scale prototype. It was also just physically large. The dimensions of the whiteboard are about 2 feet by 3 feet. The size only added to my struggles of getting the drawing mechanism to work... properly. Like I said, I got the potentiometers to control both motors, but it was still very hard to control simultaneously because of the lack of any axes. Because there were no X and Y axis that the marker would ride on, the marker would move in curves. The motors would turn and roll up the string, so whatever the length of either string is at a certain point is the radius of the curve that the marker would move in.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> The second biggest issue with that it just wasn't related to the assignment. The assignment is to create a kinetic sculpture, not a robot with no cool kinetic movement. I thought of other ways to make my mechanism to work, but I didn't think of anything that was really a kinetic sculpture. The failure was definitely discouraging, but I learned a lot from the experience of having something not go according to plan. I also learned a good bit of how to use potentiometers and how to code the turning of a potentiometer to the turning of a motor.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
             <p style="text-align: justify"> My second idea was to do something with eccentric cams. I have had prior experience in making a sculpture using cams in school, but all the parts were given to me and cut perfectly from laser-cutting machines. I wanted to create my own cam sculpture and add my own twist to it, which I did by adding in the LEDs.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"> To the right are my brainstorm sketches. At first, I wanted to bend a coat hanger in a way where the whole axle of the cam mechanism was also bent into the cams themselves, as seen in the top-right sketch. But, I figured that connecting an end of a coat hanger to the DC motor would pose to be a challenge, so I decided to go with the normal cams on an axle, as seen in the bottom right sketch. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"> By this point, I still hadn't decided what to put on the top of the mechanism (what actually moves). I am really interested in model planes- as I have many model planes and LEGO planes as well- so I wanted to somehow get a plane to move on the mechanism. At first, I wanted to make the plane bob up and down, like a rollercoaster. However, I thought that making the plane roll side-to-side would look a lot cooler, so I went with the second idea.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
             <p style="text-align: justify"> I used this Airbus A380 schematic to draw out the pieces of my plane. I didn't directly copy the schematic, though. I freehanded the whole thing, so I'm sure none of the parts are proportionally accurate to the real plane at all. But, my pieces turned out really well. I used a folding utility knife to cut out all the foamboard pieces on a Fiskars cutting mat.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"> Also, to keep my sculpture simple, I wanted to make the plane itself only be in two axes, so I didn't make the plane like a normal plane, if that makes any sense. For a while, I debated on whether or not I should glue many foamboard pieces together and then carve out the parts. I think that would've created a really unique aesthetic, but I like how my design turned out.</p><br>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
             <p style="text-align: justify"> On the left is how I did my plane part cutting. I first drew out the plane parts on a sheet of printer paper. Then, I placed the paper on the foamboard and cut out the plane part. I did this for all plane parts. </p>

             <p style="text-align: justify"> On the right is a picture of all the plane parts laid out.Like I said, because I free-handed the plane part drawings, I'm not sure how accurate the pieces actually are. But, as a whole, it looks fine. To attach the pieces to eachother, I used hot glue and a lot of patience.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12"><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify"> After finishing the plane, I moved on to the base. I didn't really want to cut out and make a foamboard box, so I used an empty Kleenex box. I turned it upside down, cut out one side, and glued that side to the bottom (the old top). This way, if I needed to hot glue something to the bottom of the box, I could. I also attached pieces of foamboard to either end of the box just so the dowel I insert wouldn't tear the side holes too fast.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"> I then made the cams and started doing test runs with and without the plane. I made the cams by cutting out circles from the foamboard; sanding the sides so they would be smooth; gluing two circles together to create a larger surface area for the cam follower to slide on; and finally taped the sides so that the surface would be extra smooth. </p>

           <p style="text-align: justify"> Originally, the cams I made were about 2 inches in diameter. This proved to be way too big when the plane started looking like it was in extreme turbulence every time the axle spinned, not to mention the cams sometimes didn't even spin because the following dowel just wouldn't go up. So, I downsized so that the diameter of each cam was 1.5 inches. It's only a half of an inch difference, but that small difference is huge in terms of how smooth the whole cam mechanism runs.</p><br>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12"><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify"> I forgot to mention, to connect the cams to the wings of the plane, I used thin wooden dowels called followers. I made a small foamboard squares on the plane to stick the dowels into. The two square pieces can be considered the engines of the plane, although the plane I modeled is the A380, which has 4 enginges, but I digress. I connected the follower to the cams by sticking the other end of the follower dowel through small, circular foamboard cut-outs that are perpendicular to the follower. I didn't use any adhesive here so that I can later easily remove the plane from the box. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"> I added a guiding part, also made out of foamboard, to the top of the box. This helps ensure that the followers are sliding vertically, with little-to-no wiggle. I also added a third dowel to the back of the plane, which angles downwards towards the box. The third dowel isn't a follower, as it isn't moving with the cams, but is there to help keep the plane stable. It isn't attached to anything besides the plane itself, so it just slides up and down another foamboard piece and is kept straight by two foamboard rectanlges that jut out of the top guiding component.  </p>
