                    <p class="gray-text"> 1. Watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc">Fusion 360 tutorial</a>. <br>
                                          2. Model either two kit components or simple household objects. <br> 
                                          3. Read <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity">What is electricity?</a>, <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit">What is a circuit?</a>, and <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power">Electric power.</a><p>

                 <h1 class="page-header">What I Did </h1>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> For this assignment, my kinetic sculpture was a foam-board plane with lights that has some degree of roll using cams. I really enjoyed making my kinetic sculpture, even though my first idea of a drawing robot didn't really work out (I talk about why later). In a nutshell, I spent a day on the drawing robot, scrapped the idea, spent a day making the plane sculpture, and then spent the last day making this webpage. I also learned a lot of different things when it comes to using the Metro board, coding on Arduino, troubleshooting Arduino code, etc. This was probably my favorite project out of the 3 we have done so far, as it incorporated many different facets of digital fabrication, like making a physical model, writing up your own code, adding whatever you want to your model, troubleshooting your model, and much more.

                      <p style="text-align: justify"> My idea for what to model on Fusion 360 was to make something had moving parts. I didn't want to make anything too complex, so I decided to make a small cologne bottle. At first, I thought it would be super easy, because I was just planning on making the glass bottle, the spray mechanism as one piece, and the cap. However, I decided that I wanted to show the inner-workings of the spray mechanism as well. This proved to be a huge undertaking, as I got stumped at many different steps. I embeded my final cologne bottle assembly below.</p><br>
