                 <h1 class="page-header">What I Did </h1>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> For this assignment, I made a mini light show. I used the Metro board, the breadboard, and Arduino IDE.  I used the conditional statements that we learned in class, like <code>if()</code> statements and used many <code>for()</code> loops, to control all 5 of the LEDs in various ways. Using both of these newly learned aspects of coding on Arduino, I was able to program 5 buttons to control 5 lights, but with a twist. In total, I'd say it took me around 4 to 5 hours to finish all of the electronics building and programming, which I think is really quick considering I had to learn how to apply the different fucntions we learned into my light show. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify"> In class, we made three main demo/challenge circuits, which I go over later. Those circuits helped me grasp the fundamentals of coding using  <code>if()</code> functions and <code>for()</code>loops. </p> 


                    <p style="text-align: justify"> For references, I didn't really use much. As usual, the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/"> Ardiono Language Reference page</a> was very helpful for searching up specifics about the various variables and functions I used. Learning about the functionality of <code>for()</code> loops was challenging, as we jumped straight into the <code>for()</code> loop, skipping the <code>while()</code> loop. The <code>for()</code> loop is essentially just a shorter version of a <code>while()</code> loop. I learned how to use the <code>while()</code> and <code>for()</code> loops by watching these cideos I embeded below. They were both really helpful</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> I really like the way it turned out, especially in the dark.

So the buttons on the back left and back right are for the shows, and the front three are for manual control of the lights.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">My orignal idea for this assignment was to actually only have the 3 front buttons, but have multiple functions for the buttons to essentialy make a manual light show. I still went with this idea, so the three buttons in the front do manually control the lights, but I ran into many issues, which I talk about later. </p><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> In all of the demo cricuits, I used a 470 Ohm resistor for the LED(s). Although, I don't really know if I needed them because I was using the one on the Metro board. For the final light show circuit, I used 100 Ohm resistors on all LEDs to keep it simple.<br></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> This lab example is one that I heavily referenced for my light show circuit, as mine uses 5 buttons, 3 of which share similar functionality. This circuit was the first time I used push buttons and the built-in pullup resistors.</p> 

                <p style="text-align: justify"> One thing we learned in class what the difference between pullup and pulldown resistors are. Our Metro boards have built-in pullup resistors, which essentially just inverts the reading. So, in my sketch, both buttons have to be pushed down while being in a <code>LOW</code> state. Now, this is only possible if we use pullup resistors or else any button press reads as a <code>HIGH</code> output, not <code>LOW</code>.</p><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> In the gif below, the red LED only turns on when both buttons are pressed. The coding for this was very helpful for my light show, as two of the LEDs and three buttons on my circuit have the same functionality as the red LED and two buttons on this circuit.</p>

                <img src="2 Button LED.gif" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="2 Button LED"><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> This was also my first time using logical operators, symbols that can be used in expressions to combine two or more relational expressions. I used <code>&&</code>, which means "and." So, in this sketch, the <code>if()</code> statement says that if the left button and right button are both both in the same state, and the left one is in a <code>LOW</code> (meaning both are in a <code>LOW</code> state), then the red LED turns on. The <code>if()</code> statement was a bit confusing to understand at first, but I soon got a better understanding of it during the lab and when I started making my own circuit.  </p>

I color-coded the positive wires: red for LEDs and yellow for buttons. And of course, black for ground. There wasn't any sort of pattern I was following in terms of where I plugged in the wires on the Metro board. For the LEDs, I used 100 Ohm resistors to keep it simple.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify"> Building the circuit was the easy part. The harder part was definitely the coding. After wiring, the first thing I did on the code was define each button and LED variable. I also defined the <code>pinMode</code> for all pins. For the LED pins, I made them all <code>OUTPUT</code>, and I made all the button pins<code>INPUT_PULLUP</code>. This way, the button logic is inverted, so when it is pressed, it is in a <code>LOW</code> state. After than, I defined three more variables for the actual state of the buttons (<code>HIGH</code> or <code>LOW</code>). </p><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> The gif below shows the three buttons controlling the three front LEDs This was just taking the demo circuit code we did in class and reformatting it to fit my circuit, which was really easy.</p>

                <img src="Single Button.gif" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Single Button"><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify">The next step was to get the back green and yellow LEDs to also work. This was also really simple. I took the demo code we did in class and added it in to mine. But, one thing to note is that I actually double hashed all of the <code>analogWrite(colorLED, 0);</code> and added in <code>else</code> statements after the button press <code>if()</code> statements. I did this because the LEDs would keep flashing on and off when I held the buttons down. I think this happened because the LEDs would be on, but since the loop keeps running, the LEDs flashed off for the <code>analogWrite(colorLED, 0);</code> part.</p> 

                <img src="Double Button No Off.gif" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Double Button No Off"><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify">I also added the final <code>if()</code> statement to make all the LEDs turn on. This was actually the hardest part to figure out, because mine kept not working. The last <code>if()</code> statement is saying if the left and middle buttons are the same state; and the right and middle buttons are the same state; and the middle button state is <code>LOW</code>, then all lights turn on. This can be seen in the gif above.</p>

                <img src="Final No Show.gif" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Final No Show"><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify">Lastly, I added code to make sure, for example, when the left and middle buttons are pressed, only the green LED lights up and not also the red and white LEDs. This is shown in the gif above. Again, this was rather simple. I just made two new <code>if()</code> statement that said when either the left and middle or right and middle buttons are pressed, only either of the back two light up by setting the front LEDs to have an <code>analongWrite</code> value of 0, meaning off.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12"> 
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> Because my V1 code didn't use any <code>for()</code> loops, I added two new buttons which added the actual light show component of my build. All I did was add two more buttons, increasing the total number of buttons from 3 to 5, and made one unique pattern for each button. Again, for the wiring, I kept the same color code (yellow for buttons and red for LEDs) and used the same 100 Ohm resistors. All I did on the actual breadboard was just add two new buttons, two yellow wires, and two black ground wires.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify"> The images below show the updated breadboard circuit with the added wires. My circuit definitely got a lot messier by adding two new buttons, but it functions fine.</p><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> In terms of actual coding, I added new variables for the two buttons and added two <code>if()</code> statement to start the LED shows. I did a lot of experimentation with the LED shows by testing out different delays and variable increments. Both LED shows use chains of <code>for()</code> loops to create the brightening and dimming lights in patterns. </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">The gif above is the show for the back left button. The coding for this is pretty simple. I just compiled many of the same <code>for()</code> loops we did in class for each individual LED. Tis was the first show I made, so I wanted to keep it simple.</p>
