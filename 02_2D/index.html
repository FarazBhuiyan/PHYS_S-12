                 <h1 class="page-header">What I Did: </h1>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> This assignment wasn't realy as overwhelming as the first one was, mainly because I have a good bit of prior experience using CAD software. In school, I learned how to use <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview?term=1-YEAR">Autodesk Inventor</a>, which is basically the same as Fusion 360. I also learned how to use <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a>, a free software also made by Autodesk. My prior experience with 3D modeling definitely helped with this assignment, albeit I still had to watch numerous tutorials on YouTube on how to do certain things on Fusion 360.  The YouTuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo29kn3d9ziFUZGZ50VKvWA">Lars Christensen</a> was a great help, as his videos are very comprehensive and get straight to the point. I have linked some of the tutorials I watched below.

                      <p style="text-align: justify"> My first idea for what to model on Fusion 360 was to make something had moving parts. I didn't want to make anything too complex, so I decided to make a small cologne bottle. At first, I thought it would be super easy, because I was just planning on making the glass bottle, the spray mechanism as one piece, and the cap. However, I decided that I wanted to show the inner-workings of the spray mechanism as well. This proved to be a huge undertaking, as I got stumped at many different steps. I embeded my final cologne bottle assembly below. I recommend clicking "Model Browser" to view all the individual parts I created and clicking "Explode Model" to easily view the hidden parts. </p>

                </div>

                <div class="row">

                  <div class="col-lg-5">
                     <p style="text-align: justify"> Something to note is that I only modeled what was visible and measurable. For example, I didn't model the actual spring that is below the tip. However, the model still functions as if there was a spring (the model functions exactly the same as it does in real life).</p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> One thing that I really had to learn was combining different pieces using the join function. In Autodesk Inventor, the way you combine different parts is by constraining different axis, until you reach the desired function. So on Inventor, if you wanted to create a rigid joint, you would constrain all 6 of the axis. However, on Fusion 360, when you create a join, it restrains all of the axis first. Then, you individually un-constrain certain axis and fuctions. This was definitely a bit of a learning curve, but I soon figured out many of the key "joint" functions and was able to create a functioning cologne bottle model.

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> I tried my best to make the modeled components color-accurate to the real life cologne bottle as well, although it was a bit challenging. For one, the glass itself is really difficult to see in the model viewer. I tried changing the color of the glass, but it didn't really make a difference. Also, the plastic pieces on the inside aren't very color-accurate. For example, the plastic pieces in real life are quite opaque but still somewhat transparent. On the model, they are completely solid. So, I added direct-comparison pictures below to view the actual cologne bottle and my design side-by-side.</p>
