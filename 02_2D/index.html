                 <h1 class="page-header">What I Did </h1>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> This assignment wasn't realy as overwhelming as the first one was, mainly because I have a good bit of prior experience using CAD software. In school, I learned how to use <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview?term=1-YEAR">Autodesk Inventor</a>, which is basically the same as Fusion 360. I also learned how to use <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a>, a free software also made by Autodesk. My prior experience with 3D modeling has definitely helped with this assignment even though I still had to watch numerous tutorials on YouTube on how to do certain things on Fusion 360.  The YouTuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo29kn3d9ziFUZGZ50VKvWA">Lars Christensen</a> was a great help, as his videos are very comprehensive and get straight to the point. I have linked some of the tutorials I watched below.

                      <p style="text-align: justify"> My idea for what to model on Fusion 360 was to make something had moving parts. I didn't want to make anything too complex, so I decided to make a small cologne bottle. At first, I thought it would be super easy, because I was just planning on making the glass bottle, the spray mechanism as one piece, and the cap. However, I decided that I wanted to show the inner-workings of the spray mechanism as well. This proved to be a huge undertaking, as I got stumped at many different steps. I embeded my final cologne bottle assembly below. 

                     <p style="text-align: justify">For the model viewer below, I recommend clicking "Model Browser" to view all the individual parts I created and clicking "Explode Model" to easily view the hidden parts. Also, my model is downloadable by clicking the blue "Open in Fusion 360" button at the bottom right-hand side of the model viewer. Alternatively, you can click <a href="https://a360.co/35U9TI7">here</a> to view and download the model through the Fusion 360 My Hub website. If you would like to use my model or parts of it, all I ask is that you credit my work. </p>

                    <div class="col-lg-5">
                     <p style="text-align: justify"> Something to note is that I only modeled what was visible and measurable. For example, I didn't model the actual spring that is below the tip. However, the model still functions as if there was a spring (the model functions exactly the same as it does in real life).</p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> One thing that I had to learn was how to properly use the joint function. In Inventor, the way to combine different parts is by constraining a piece's different axes so it doesn't move or moves only in a certain way. So on Inventor, to create a rigid joint, all 6 axes would need to be constrained. However, on Fusion 360, a joint restrains all axes first. Then, certain axes need to be individually un-constrained to create certain functions, like arotating door knob. This is the complete opposite to the constraining methods of Inventor. There was definitely a small learning curve, but I figured it out quickly and was able to make a pretty accurate model.

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> I tried my best to make the modeled components as color-accurate as possible, although it was a bit challenging. For one, the glass itself is really difficult to see in the model viewer. I tried changing the color of the glass, but it didn't really make a difference. Also, the plastic pieces on the inside aren't very color-accurate. For example, the plastic pieces in real life are quite opaque but still somewhat transparent. On the model, they are completely solid. So, I added direct-comparison pictures further below to view the actual cologne bottle and my design side-by-side.</p><br><br>

                     <p style="text-align: justify">To show the moving parts of my model, I created an animation inside of Fusion 360. The animation browser is very intuitive. I just set the home view as the first point-of-reference, then scrubbed to 7 seconds in the timeline, and finally set the last view on the other side of the bottle as the final view. That's how I got the "camera" on the GIF to essentially orbit around the front of the bottle. I did the same thing for the motion as well. I made the starting position of the spray nozzle and the cap to be the normal position of the cologne bottle. Then, I made the cap move up with a duration 3 seconds and later made the cap come down for the same time duration. The nozzle spray has a total period time of 1 seconds, so it goes down and up in half of a second each.</p><br><br>

For every set, I wrote a brief summary of my findings and what I found interesting in each set. This was a really fun side project, as I was able to compare the actual to the model to the final, rendered model to see the similarities and differences. Just to note, the reason that the images under the "model" category look a bit different in proportion to the actual and rendered views is because the model images are a little bit misaligned. Otherwise, all of the images below are taken in perspective view, which more realistically depicts width, height, and depth, than orthographic view does. </p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify">Because there are 10 pieces to my cologne bottle, which are all made with the same or very similar methods, I will just go over how I made the main glass bottle part. The biggest difference between the glass body and the other parts is that the body is rectangular and the other parts are circular. Otherwise, I used the same methods to make all parts.  </p><br>

                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/1.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="First Sketch">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">1. I first made a rectangular sketch according to the measurements I took of the body. For other parts, I either made a circle or part of a circle.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/2.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="First Extrusion">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">2. I then extruded the sketch, again to the measurements of the body. The extrusion is a "New Body" because it's the only body that I've made so far.</p>
                    </div >

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/3.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Bottom Cut">
                        <p style="text-align: justify">3. There is a a rectangular indent at the bottom of the bottle (probably for design purposes). I sketched it out and extruded it. Note: the extrusion is a "Cut," not a "New Body," because it is cutting into the main body.</p>
                    </div >

                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/4.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Bottom Cut Fillet">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">4. Then, I did fillets on the inner and outer edge of the extrusion cut I just made, as it is smooth in real life. I made a rough estimate for the fillet radius.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/5.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Bottom Feet">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">5. I also added 3 "feet" to the bottom of the container. I first made the sketch, then extruded outwards, and lastly fillet them.</p>
                    </div >

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/6.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Inside Hole Sketch">
                        <p style="text-align: justify">6. Getting to the inside hole now, it's not a perfect rectanglular prism on the inside. So, I made a rough sketch using the spline tool on a plane that was offset to about 3mm from one side.</p>
                    </div >
                </div>

                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/7.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Inner Extrusion">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">7. I then extruded the inside hole sketch, making sure it's on the "Cut" mode. One caveat to making the hole using this method is that it isn't entirely accurate. The length of the extrustion is not flat in real life.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/11.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Inner Fillet">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">8. To finish off the inner area, I fillet both edges to mimick the smooth interior of the real bottle.</p>
                    </div >

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/8.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Outer Fillet">
                        <p style="text-align: justify">9. I fillet the outer body edges. This can be done at any step. I chose to do it now because I was also doing fillets on the interior.</p>
                    </div >
                </div>

                <div class="row"><br><br> <!-- Step 10-12 -->

                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/9.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Top Hole Sketch">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">10. For the hole on the top, I used two circles to create the outer edge. The inner circle will be the opening.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                         <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/10.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Top Hole Extrusion">
                         <p style="text-align: justify">11. I extruded the outer rim upwards and extruded the inner circle inwards, making sure that the inner extrusion went far enough to extrude into the hole.</p>
                    </div >

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <img src="Cologne Body Tutorial/12.png" class="img-rounded2" style="width:100%" alt="Final Cologne Body">
                        <p style="text-align: justify">12. The last step is to change the material to glass (this can be done at any step). That's all there is to it. For the other components, I just created a "New Component" on the body design, so I can easily make the shapes accurate.</p>
