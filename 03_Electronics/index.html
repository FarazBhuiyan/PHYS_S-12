                    <p style="text-align: justify"> Coming into this assignment, I had no prior experience with using microcontrollers, breadboards, components of breadboard circuits, or coding using arduino, so I had to learn all of the basics of using breadboards and coding on arduino. One really valuable resource I used was <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a>. I have used Tinkercad in the past to model 3D objects, but it can also be used for creating, coding, and simulating circuits. Using Tinkercad, I made simulations of the circuits I made in real life, and I experimented by using different components on my circuits. I also just experimented on various different circuits using the multimeter to see how changes I made, like swapping resistors, affected the overall circuit. This assignment was definitely a bit of a challenge, mainly because I had basically no prior knowledge on anything to do with circuits, but it was really fun to experiment with different circuit components to see what happened.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify"> To the right, there is a picture of the circuit demo we made in class. It's a very basic setup and doesn't require any coding. The parts include the Metro microcontroller, a 100Ohm (Ω) resistor, a red LED, and some black and red coated wiring.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">On the Metro board, I plugged in the red wire to the 3.3V connector and the black wire to the ground connector. The red wire connects to a 100Ω resistor. The other end of the resistor is connected to the red LED, and then the rest is just connected to ground. One key thing that I learned about the LED is that the anode (the long lead) was connected to positive, while the cathode (the small lead) was connected to ground. For the resistor, polarity doesn't matter. Also, for this particular circuit, it doesn't matter whether I put my positive cable in the 3.3V or 5V. However, if I plug something else into one of the analog connectors, then there is a chance that I fry the board if I plug it into the 5V socket.</p><br>

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> After making my circuit, I measured the voltages at 5 different locations and marked them down. Points A through E are marked on the picture below as well as marked on the schematic drawing of the circuit. Using the icons I learned from the basic components sheet, I drew out the circuit schematic with the icons representing the Metro board, the 100Ω resistor, and the red LED. I also used Ohm's Law to calculate the current in the system. Below, the images show a schematic for the basic LED circuit that I made and a position vs voltage graph. There's also my work to calculate the current in the system. Doing this extra analysis was a great way to really understand what was happening in the system and learn how parts like the LED light and the resistor affect the system as a whole.</p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify"> Just a quick note, I made the hand-drawn diagrams and did my work on the iPad app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602">GoodNotes 5</a>, and I labeled the breadboard image using Google Slides.</p><br><br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Now I will go over and analyze the data I collected. So, looking at the first "Basic LED Circuit Schematic" drawing, it directly matches my breadboard circuit. Except instead of the battery, I used the Metro board to power the circuit. Talking a look at the graph, all the numbers I collected make sense when you look at what's exactly happening in the circuit. I used these drawing and pictures to get a better understanding of circuits.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Positions A and B are both before any component, including the resistor, so there is no change in voltage. Then, after the resistor at position C, the voltage drops to 2.4 (the actual number was fluctuating between 2.39 and 2.4, so I just rounded up). This means that the 100Ω resistor drops the voltage by 0.9V. After that, at positions D and E, there is no voltage because the voltage is used by the LED, as both those postions are also ground wires. After position E, the circuit finishes its loop and starts back at 3.3V at position A.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Using Ohm's law, I calculated that the current in my system is 0.009 amperes (A), or 9 milliamperes (mA). This was calculated by first finding the change in voltage, which was 0.9, and dividing that by the resistance, which is 100 because of the 100Ω resistor.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">The blinking LED is probably one of the most common examples of basic arduino coding. As such, the blinking LED is a demo we did in class. The idea is quite simple: the LED blinks on and off for a set period of time. There was no coding (by me) involved, as the blink code is already an example that is given on the Arduino code editor. Since this was the first time I'd be uploading a code sketch from my computer to the Metro board, I had a few steps on the Arduino software to finish first. To get the code from the editor on my computer to my Metro board, I plugged the board into my PC using a USB to micro USB cable. I fiddled around with the board and COM settings to make sure it was on the right board, and then I simple clicked "Upload" on the Arduio software. That's really all there is to it for uploading new Arduino sketches onto a microcontroller.</p>

        <div class="row"><br>
            <div class="col-sm-7">

                <p style="text-align: justify">The way that the light blinking actually works is by the board using a technique for controlling power called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The PWM output produces pulses of power of various set time lengths, instead of constant power seen without PWM, and I used it to change the status of the LED to either on or off.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">The image above is a vsual of what the blink circuit looks like: the LED on the Metro board flashes on and off. This makes sense because in the code to the left, the pin that is being used as the output is "LED_BUILTIN," which is the Metro board's built-in LED. To get the LED on the breadboard to flash, as seen below, I connected the positive wire to the 13th digital socket instead of the 3.3V socket connector. The reason this works without changing any code is because the 13th digital socket also functions as the "LED_BUILTIN" pin.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">This circuit is the first one that I've used the potentiometer in, as well as an analog socket. The way that potentiometer works is by a knob controlling how much resistance is in the circuit. So, if the knob is turned all the way, then the output would be close to 0. And if the knob is turned all the way to the other side, the output will be 1023. Likewise, if the knob is turned to somewhere In the Arduino embed below, there are two different analog read serial codes. Again, this was an example code from the Arduino basic example list, but in the lab session, we edited the example code so when we looked at the serial monitor (what was being outputted from the analog 0 socket), it would show a normal voltage number instead of a unitless value from 0-1023. I talk more on this below.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="row"><br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Looking at the code above, the edits we made to the example code are to make the serial monitor output also produce a numerical voltage amount, instead of just numbers from 0 to 1023. For example, the way we converted the 1024 scale to a 0 to 3.3V scale is by adding in this line: "Serial.println(map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 3.3));" The map function is used as the converter, so the 1024 scale is just scaled down to a 3.3V scale. 

                   <p style="text-align: justify">The reason the voltages appearing on the right are integers is because I have it set in the code to produce integers. I tried making it produce fractional values so it would produce an exact decimal range from 0 to 3.3, but when I tried, it didn't work. So, I just left it as an integer. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Also, the reason the "sensor Values" range from 0 to 1023 is because the Metro board we are using uses 10-bit Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC). This means that the values produced are a 10-bit range of 1024 quantifiable numbers that we can use to measure other values, like voltage. Also, the reason the range I am getting is from 0 to 1023 is because including 0, the range from 0 to 1023 is 1024.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">Voltage dividers were also something we learned about during the lab session. I learned that they form the basis for different types of sensors. The circuit I made is a very basic model of how a voltage divider works, and they can definitely get very complex the more components are in the circuit. However, understanding how this basic voltage divider works was really helpful when comparing my data to other circuits to see how different components linked together affect the voltage at different points of a circuit. </p><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify"> The Voltage Divider diagram on the right is what I folowed to make my circuit. The equations below the diagram work interchangably, meaning you can plug in either resistor value for R1 or R2 and you will still get the same answer. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">I learned that if the resistors are the same resistance, for example, if both are 10kΩ, then the voltage between the resistors will be exactly half of the system input. In my circuit, I made the system input 3.3V, so the divided voltage is 1.65V The math also checks out. If we take a look at the V1 equation (to find the voltage between the two resistors), R1 and R2 in my circuit are both 10kΩ, so R1+R2 is 20kΩ. This simplifies to 1/2. One half of 3.3V is 1.65V, which is what the multimeter shows. Likewise, that also means that the V2 equals 1.65V, because it has the same variables as V1, like voltage and resistance. This means that after the second resistor, there are 0 volts left in the circuit.

                <p style="text-align: justify">Like I said before, the voltage is only split exactly in half between two resistors when the resistance level of the two resistors is the same. This is proven in the image below with the red LED replacing the second resistor. The voltage after the first resistor is 1.73V, which is not half of 3.3V. The LED is using more volts than the seconds resistor in the first image was reducing, which is why the voltage just before the LED is higher than in the first image. </p>
